    ====================================

    make the dom universal

    # TODO - start with just tags.
    # TODO - then see how to tackle attributes?
    # TODO - this wont do docstrings or params

    # TODO - also consider mapping dom method names and classes to localised counterparts?
    # i.e. localiseTemplates per lang
    # xxx = Event Target
    # xxx.xxx = add Event Listener
    # xxx.xxx = remove Event Listener
    # xxx.xxx = dispatch Event

    # even had the idea of doing all the python builtins and list methods etc.
    # but that would be too much and should be another pypi package if not already exists.
